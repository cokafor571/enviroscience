            <h2>What you need to know about Asbestos</h2>
            <p>
                Asbestos is a carcinogen that can be found in buildings. When asbestos-containing materials
                otherwise known as ACM are damaged, fibers containing asbestos can be get into the air which
                can potentially be very hazardous for occupants.
            </p>
            <h2>Common misconceptions about Asbestos</h2>
            <p>
                A visual inspection is not sufficient to determine the existence of asbestos. One
                can only test for asbestos with laboratory testing of the damaged material which is
                accomplished by an Asbestos Survey or Screening. It is absolutely vital that building owners or
                purchasers know whether a building has ACM so that it can be taken care of properly. After
                identification, asbestos can be safely sealed and effectively removed. We provide these
                services to our clients.

            <h2>What you need to know about Lead</h2>
            <p>
                Lead was widely used in paint for residential and commercial buildings before 1978. However,
                lead is toxic for both humans and animals and lead poisoning is somewhat common in young
                children. Adults are also susceptible to lead poisoning under a few conditions as well. While “do
                it yourself” lead inspection kits are available, they are by no means 100% reliable. We can
                minimize your risk by bringing in our professional team who can test and remove any lead
                based paint that you may have on the property.

            <h2>What you need to know about Mold</h2>
            <p>
                Mold is a common household issue that affects even the cleanest of homes due to the fact that
                mold grows in any environment where there is moisture buildup. Places in the home like
                bathrooms, kitchens and basements are all environments where mold can thrive. If there are
                any suspicions that you may have a mold problem, contact Enviroscience Solutions right away
                and we will have a representative reach out to you. Mold can be a pesky issue so we make sure
                to test the entire site comprehensively so ensure the complete removal of any mold on the
                premises.

            <h2>What you need to know about Soil</h2>
            <p>
                Soil testing, or a soil analysis, is usually required for building permits to ensure that there is no
                contaminants in the ground. A soil analysis can be ordered by a home buyer or real estate
                agent to learn of any potential hazards that could adversely affect their home and investment.
                For instance, a vast majority of home buyers are not prepared for all the complications of hillside
                living, including erosion, gullies, and landslides caused by intense winter rains. Soil testing by
                our licensed professionals can make homeowners aware of the some of the risks involved in
                such homes and we also make them away of potential courses of action that can safegaurd
                them against such pitfalls going forward.
